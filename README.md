# statistical-learning-classification-kaggle
Code from Kaggle competition for STAT 441 (Statistical Learning - Classification). Worked with Roy Chen and Taeun Lee, and we placed 5th of 38 groups.

We focused heavily on the data cleansing and fit a simple-to-understand logistic regression to achieve our final result :)
